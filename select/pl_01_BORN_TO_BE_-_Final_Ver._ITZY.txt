Come on
Come on
I'm on it
Born to be, born to be,
born to be oh
Brand new fire
이젠 내 시간이야
let me turn the tide, move
Ice blue silver
I'm shining like a star,
I go boom go boom
Sit down enjoy the show
cuz it's about to go down
Transcend 한계를 넘어
now I'm running it
딱 봐도 yeah I'm the realest
절대 없어 I got nothing missing
모든 시선들이 나를 향해
잠든 감각들이 깨어나
I'll prove it
Don't need your permission
Every step I take
is in victory lane yeah
I'm about to have
this whole crowd going
Crazy like 한 번도
느껴본 적 없는
Can you see what
I've become now?
Yeah let's turn it up now
Born to be, born to be,
born to be oh oh
Born to be, born to be,
wild and free oh oh
누가 뭐라 해도
Imma say it louder
난 내 방식대로
always hit it harder
Born to be, born to be,
wild and free oh oh
Born to be so fierce
한 번도 못 느낀 fears
Sensation Imma bring yeah
Get ready don't be tense
따라오는 spotlight
watch me glow
Young and wild and free
더 자신 있게
이젠 nothing's going wrong
Don't compare 다른 것들
just don't care 내 맘대로
Bounce it, bounce it,
turn it up
Got that winning pace
I'm going up
모든 시선들이 나를 향해
잠든 감각들이 깨어나
I'll prove it
Can you see what
I've become now?
Yeah let's turn it up now
Born to be, born to be,
born to be oh oh
Born to be, born to be,
wild and free oh oh
누가 뭐라 해도
Imma say it louder
난 내 방식대로
always hit it harder
Born to be, born to be,
wild and free oh oh
누가 뭐라 해도
Imma say it
누가 뭐라 해도
always hit it
Born to be, born to be,
born to be
Born to be, born to be,
born to be oh oh
Born to be, born to be,
wild and free oh oh
누가 뭐라 해도
Imma say it louder
난 내 방식대로
always hit it harder
Born to be, born to be,
wild and free oh oh
